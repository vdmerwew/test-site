  <h3 style="text-align:center;">HEALTH ISSUES</h3>
  <h2>Australian Shepherd Health</h2>

  <p>Australian Shepherds, while generally a healthy and robust breed, are predisposed to certain health issues, some of which are hereditary. Awareness of these potential problems is crucial for owners and breeders to ensure the well-being of their dogs. Here are some of the common health concerns in Australian Shepherds:</p>

  <h3>Orthopaedic Issues:</h3>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Hip Dysplasia:</strong> This occurs when the hip joint doesn't develop properly, leading to instability, pain, and eventually arthritis. Responsible breeders screen their dogs for hip and elbow dysplasia. Ideally breeders should only breed dogs with A and B hips.</li>
      <li><strong>Elbow Dysplasia:</strong> Similar to hip dysplasia, this involves the abnormal development of the elbow joint, also leading to arthritis and pain. Screening of breeding dogs is also important for this condition. Breeders should only breed with elbow scores of 0.</li>
      <li><strong>Cranial Cruciate Ligament (CCL) Injuries:</strong> Due to their active nature, Aussies are at risk for tears in this knee ligament, which can cause lameness and require surgical intervention.</li>
      <li><strong>Spondylosis:</strong> A degenerative spinal disease where bone spurs (osteophytes) form along the vertebrae, potentially bridging them. It's often associated with aging, injury, or wear and tear, but can also have a genetic component in some cases.</li>
      <li><strong>Note:</strong> While not directly caused by Natural Bobtail (NBT), some orthopaedic issues are more prevalent in Australian Shepherds with NBT due to the genetic nature of the trait.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Eye Conditions:</h3>
  <p>Australian Shepherds are prone to several inherited eye diseases. Regular eye exams by a veterinary ophthalmologist are recommended.</p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA):</strong> A group of degenerative diseases affecting the retina, leading to progressive vision loss, starting with night blindness and eventually causing complete blindness. There is no cure, but genetic testing can identify affected dogs and carriers.</li>
      <li><strong>Hereditary Cataracts: (HSF4)</strong> Clouding of the lens of the eye that can impair vision and potentially lead to blindness. Cataracts can develop at a young age in Aussies (juvenile cataracts) and can be inherited. Surgery is the primary treatment option.</li>
      <li><strong>Collie Eye Anomaly (CEA):</strong> An inherited condition involving abnormal development of the eye, particularly the choroid (a layer beneath the retina). It can range from mild with little vision impact to severe with potential vision loss. Genetic testing is available.</li>
      <li><strong>Iris Hypoplasia:</strong> A congenital condition where the iris tissue is thinner than normal, potentially leading to a hole (colomboma) in the iris.</li>
      <li><strong>Iris Coloboma:</strong> A part of the iris doesn't develop completely. It usually has minimal impact on vision unless the defect is large. It's more common in merle-coloured Aussies and can be associated with Collie Eye Anomaly.</li>
      <li><strong>Distichiasis:</strong> Extra eyelashes growing in an abnormal location on the eyelid, which can irritate the eye.</li>
      <li><strong>Pannus (Chronic Superficial Keratitis):</strong> An immune-mediated condition affecting the cornea, leading to inflammation and potentially vision impairment. It's often managed with medication.</li>
      <li><strong>Tapetum Lucidum:</strong> The tapetum lucidum is a reflective layer behind the retina that enhances night vision by reflecting light back to the photoreceptor cells. Dogs with blue eyes or the merle gene often lack a tapetum lucidum or have a less pigmented one, which can result in a “red-eye” effect in photos. This is because the red blood vessels in the eye are visible instead of the characteristic blue or green reflection of a normal tapetum. Lacking a tapetum does not necessarily indicate a medical issue or hinder a dog’s overall vision.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Neurological Conditions</h2>

  <ul>
      <li>
          <strong>Epilepsy:</strong>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Primary (Idiopathic/Inherited) Epilepsy:</strong> Australian Shepherds are particularly prone to primary or idiopathic/inherited epilepsy. This means that the seizures are not caused by an identifiable underlying condition like a brain tumor, injury, or metabolic problem. It is believed to have a genetic origin.</li>
              <li><strong>Note:</strong> By 2007, veterinary geneticists were already discussing the inheritance patterns of epilepsy in dogs. More recent research has reinforced the idea that epilepsy in certain breeds, including Australian Shepherds, has a strong genetic link. In 2022 most research labs changed the terminology from idiopathic epilepsy to inherited epilepsy. However, the terminology change isn't universally adopted yet—many veterinarians still use both terms interchangeably.</li>
              <li><strong>Inheritance Pattern:</strong> While it's clear that epilepsy is inherited in Australian Shepherds, the exact mode of inheritance is currently unknown. Research suggests it's likely complex, possibly involving multiple genes. This means that healthy parents can still produce affected offspring, and both parents may carry the genes for epilepsy even if they don't show symptoms themselves.</li>
              <li><strong>Age of Onset:</strong> If an Australian Shepherd has inherited epilepsy, seizures typically begin between six months and three years of age. Seizure starting around 2 years of age are often referred to as adult-onset inherited epilepsy.</li>
              <li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> There is no specific test to diagnose inherited epilepsy in Australian Shepherds. It is diagnosed by exclusion, meaning a veterinarian will rule out all other possible causes of seizures before determining it is primary epilepsy.</li>
              <li><strong>Management:</strong> Epilepsy in Australian Shepherds cannot be cured. Treatment usually involves lifelong medication to help control the seizures. The type and dosage of medication will vary depending on the individual dog, and regular blood tests are often needed to monitor the medication's effectiveness and potential side effects.</li>
              <li><strong>Breeding Considerations:</strong> Due to the likelihood of inheritance, it is strongly discouraged to breed any Australian Shepherd that has epilepsy or is a first-degree relative (parents, siblings, offspring) of an affected dog. Breeding more distant relatives should be done with great care, considering their potential to carry epilepsy genes.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Hereditary Ataxia (Australian Shepherd Type):</strong> A progressive neurological disease causing an uncoordinated gait and loss of balance, typically appearing in young dogs. Genetic testing is available.</li>
      <li><strong>Hypomyelinogenesis:</strong> Characterized by generalized body tremors. This condition, more common in Australian shepherds, involves incomplete development of myelin, the fatty sheath that insulates nerve fibers. It can cause tremors, particularly in the hindquarters, and may be associated with other neurological issues like clumsiness.</li>
      <li><strong>Shaker Syndrome:</strong> A condition characterized by diffuse body tremoring, often associated with mild inflammatory Central Nervous System (CNS) disease.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Drug Sensitivity</h2>

  <h3>Multidrug Resistance 1 (MDR1) Gene Mutation:</h3>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>What is MDR1?</strong> MDR1 is a gene that produces a protein called P-glycoprotein. This protein plays a crucial role in transporting certain drugs out of the body, including the brain.</li>
      <li><strong>The Mutation:</strong> Many Australian Shepherds carry a mutation in the MDR1 gene. This mutation results in a defective P-glycoprotein that cannot effectively remove certain drugs. This can lead to a buildup of these drugs in the brain, causing severe neurological toxicity.</li>
      <li><strong>Prevalence in Aussies:</strong> Approximately 50% of Australian Shepherds are estimated to carry at least one copy of the mutated MDR1 gene.</li>
      <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> The MDR1 mutation is inherited. Dogs can have:
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Normal/Normal (N/N):</strong> Clear: Two normal copies of the gene. These dogs are not sensitive to MDR1-related drugs and cannot pass the mutation to their offspring.</li>
              <li><strong>Normal/Mutant (N/MDR1):</strong> Carrier: One normal and one mutated copy. These dogs are carriers and can be sensitive to higher doses of some drugs. They can pass the mutation to 50% of their offspring. It is important to note that there is much contention to the word “carrier” in MDR1 terms. We often hear the term “MDR1 carrier, treat as if affected”. This is incorrect. Dogs require only one mutant copy to be affected, as the MDR1 gene is dominant. “Carriers” are affected, though their reactions might be milder than those with two mutated copies.</li>
              <li><strong>Mutant/Mutant (MDR1/MDR1):</strong> Affected: Two mutated copies. These dogs are highly sensitive to MDR1-related drugs, even at low doses. They will pass the mutation to all of their offspring.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Australian Shepherds with the MDR1 mutation can have adverse reactions to a number of common medications, including:</strong>
          <ul>
              <li>Ivermectin: A common ingredient in heartworm preventatives. While low doses in heartworm medication are generally safe, higher doses (e.g., for treating mange) can be toxic.</li>
              <li>Acepromazine: A tranquilizer.</li>
              <li>Butorphanol: A pain reliever and sedative.</li>
              <li>Loperamide (Imodium): An anti-diarrheal medication.</li>
              <li>Vincristine, Vinblastine, Doxorubicin, Paclitaxel: Chemotherapy drugs.</li>
              <li>Emodepside (found in some dewormers)</li>
              <li>Erythromycin (an antibiotic)</li>
              <li>Digoxin (used for heart conditions)</li>
              <li>Ondansetron (anti-nausea medication)</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Drugs to Use with Caution</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Moxidectin (in some flea/tick preventatives)</li>
            <li>Selamectin (in Revolution, a flea/tick treatment)</li>
            <li>Cyclosporine (immune system suppressant)</li>
            <li>Morphine, Buprenorphine, Fentanyl (opioid pain relievers)</li>
            <li>Doxycycline (antibiotic—generally safe but should be monitored)</li>
            <li>Verapamil, Diltiazem, Quinidine (heart medications)</li>
            <li>Metoclopramide, Domperidone (anti-nausea drugs)</li>
            <li>Dexamethasone (glucocorticoid steroid)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Symptoms of Toxicity:</h3>
        <p>If an Australian Shepherd with the MDR1 mutation is given an affected drug, they may exhibit symptoms such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vomiting</li>
            <li>Weakness</li>
            <li>Lack of coordination (ataxia)</li>
            <li>Lethargy</li>
            <li>Tremors</li>
            <li>Seizures</li>
            <li>Blindness</li>
            <li>In severe cases, death.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Testing:</h3>
        <p>A simple DNA test can determine an Australian Shepherd's MDR1 status. This test is highly recommended for all Australian Shepherds.</p>

        <h3>Management:</h3>
        <p>There is no cure for MDR1 sensitivity. The key is prevention by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Knowing your dog's MDR1 status.</li>
            <li>Informing your veterinarian of your dog's status.</li>
            <li>Avoid using problematic drugs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Always discuss your Australian Shepherd's MDR1 status with your veterinarian before administering any new drugs.</p>
        <p>A list of problematic medicine can be viewed on the website of “Washington State University” <a href="https://prime.vetmed.wsu.edu/2022/03/01/problem-medications-for-dogs/" target="_blank">https://prime.vetmed.wsu.edu/2022/03/01/problem-medications-for-dogs/</a></p>

        <h2>Other Health Concerns</h2>

        <h3>Autoimmune Diseases:</h3>
        <p>Australian Shepherds can be predisposed to various autoimmune disorders, where the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. Examples include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Autoimmune thyroiditis</li>
            <li>Lupus</li>
            <li>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)</li>
            <li>Pemphigus</li>
            <li>Addisons disease</li>
            <li>Immune-Mediated Hemolytic Anemia (IMHA)</li>
            <li>Myasthenia Gravis</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cancer:</h3>
        <p><strong>Hemangiosarcoma (HSA)</strong> is a very aggressive cancer of vascular tissue (blood vessels) and is a common inherited cancer in the Australian Shepherd breed. It often affects the spleen, heart, and skin, and can spread to other organs like the lungs and liver. While the skin form can sometimes be cured with tumor removal, the prognosis for most other forms is poor, with many dogs surviving only a few weeks or months after diagnosis.</p>
        <p>Key points about hemangiosarcoma in Australian Shepherds:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Inherited Cancer:</strong> HSA is one of three inherited cancers in the breed, the others being lymphoma and Histiocytic Sarcoma.</li>
            <li><strong>Vascular Tissue Cancer:</strong> It originates in the endothelial cells of blood vessels.</li>
            <li><strong>Common Locations:</strong> Tumors often start in the spleen, heart, and skin.</li>
            <li><strong>Metastasis:</strong> HSA can spread readily to other organs, particularly the lungs and liver.</li>
            <li><strong>Poor Prognosis:</strong> Most dogs with HSA have a short lifespan after diagnosis.</li>
            <li><strong>Treatment:</strong> Surgery, and sometimes chemotherapy (Mdr1 dependent), can help prolong life, but there is currently no cure.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Lymphoma:</strong> lymphoma in Australian Shepherds, a cancer of the white blood cells, which is a common inherited cancer in the breed. Lymphoma can affect various organs like lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow, and symptoms include lethargy, weight loss, and swollen lymph nodes. The prognosis varies, but treatment often involves chemotherapy, which can lead to remission, though relapses are common.</p>

        <p><strong>Histiocytic Sarcoma:</strong> An aggressive cancer that can affect Australian Shepherds. It originates from histiocytes, a type of immune cell, and can appear in various organs, including the spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and lymph nodes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Weakness, lethargy, weight loss, and organ dysfunction.</li>
            <li><strong>Treatment:</strong> Often involves chemotherapy, surgery, and supportive care, but prognosis is generally poor.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Mast Cell Tumors:</strong> Skin tumors that can be benign or malignant.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Lumps or bumps on the skin, which may change size or appearance.</li>
            <li><strong>Notes:</strong> Early surgical removal offers the best prognosis.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Osteosarcoma:</strong> A bone cancer more commonly seen in larger dogs, but possible in Aussies.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Lameness, swelling over a bone, pain when touched.</li>
            <li><strong>Notes:</strong> Fast-spreading; early diagnosis is critical.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Risk Factors and Genetics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Genetic Predisposition:</strong> Some cancers, like hemangiosarcoma, histiocytic sarcoma and lymphoma, have a strong hereditary component in Australian Shepherds.</li>
            <li><strong>Age:</strong> Risk increases as Aussies get older (especially after age 7).</li>
            <li><strong>Environment:</strong> Exposure to certain chemicals, second-hand smoke, or toxins may add to genetic risk.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Responsible breeders aim to reduce cancer risk by carefully selecting breeding dogs with long-lived, cancer-free family lines.</p>
        <h2>What You Can Do</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Know your dog's family history — Ask breeders about cancer in bloodlines.</li>
            <li>Schedule regular veterinary exams — Especially for Aussies over 7 years old.</li>
            <li>Monitor for warning signs — Sudden weakness, lumps, weight loss, lethargy.</li>
            <li>Consider annual health screenings — Blood tests, ultrasounds, and senior wellness panels.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Other Health Conditions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hypothyroidism:</strong> A condition where the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormone, leading to various symptoms like lethargy, weight gain, and skin problems.</li>
            <li><strong>Dental Disease:</strong> Like all breeds, Aussies can develop dental issues if proper oral hygiene isn't maintained.</li>
            <li><strong>Obesity:</strong> Due to their good appetite, Aussies can become overweight if their diet and exercise are not managed properly.</li>
            <li><strong>Parasites:</strong> They are susceptible to common parasites like fleas, ticks, worms, and ear mites.</li>
            <li><strong>Allergies:</strong> Skin and food allergies can occur in Australian Shepherds.</li>
            <li><strong>Cobalamin Malabsorption (Vitamin B12 Malabsorption):</strong> A genetic condition preventing proper absorption of vitamin B12, leading to poor growth and other issues. Genetic testing is available.</li>
            <li><strong>Hyperuricosuria:</strong> A genetic condition that can lead to the formation of urate stones in the urinary tract. Genetic testing is available.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Congenital Heart Conditions</h3>
        <p>Australian Shepherds can inherit certain congenital heart conditions, which are present from birth and may affect their heart function. Some of the most notable hereditary heart conditions in Aussies include:</p>
        <h4>Common Hereditary Heart Conditions in Australian Shepherds</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA):</strong> A defect where a fetal blood vessel fails to close after birth, leading to improper circulation and potential heart failure.</li>
            <li><strong>Persistent Right Aortic Arch (PRAA):</strong> A congenital defect that can cause swallowing difficulties and heart strain.</li>
            <li><strong>Subaortic Stenosis (SAS):</strong> A narrowing of the heart’s outflow tract, which can lead to heart murmurs and reduced circulation.</li>
            <li><strong>Mitral Valve Disease:</strong> A condition where the heart valves weaken, leading to inefficient blood flow.</li>
            <li><strong>Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM):</strong> A disease that weakens the heart muscle, reducing its ability to pump blood effectively.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's important to note that not every Australian Shepherd will develop these conditions. However, being aware of these potential health issues allows owners to be proactive in their dog's care, choose responsible breeders who health test their dogs, and seek veterinary attention promptly if any signs of illness arise. Regular veterinary check-ups, a balanced diet, appropriate exercise, and good grooming are essential for maintaining the health and wellbeing of an Australian Shepherd.</p>

        <p>A healthy Aussie is a happy Aussie — and a happy Aussie is a joy for life.</p>

        <h2>Aussie Health Checklist: Signs to Watch For</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Limping or stiffness — Especially after exercise or when getting up.</li>
            <li>Changes in appetite or weight — Eating much more or less than usual, sudden weight gain or loss.</li>
            <li>Itchy skin or frequent scratching — Could signal allergies, parasites, or skin infections.</li>
            <li>Cloudy, red, or weepy eyes — Possible signs of cataracts, eye injuries, or inherited conditions.</li>
            <li>Seizures or unusual "spaced out" behaviour — Can indicate epilepsy or toxin exposure.</li>
            <li>Constant licking, chewing paws, or scooting — May point to allergies, anal gland issues and pinched nerves.</li>
            <li>Excessive tiredness or low energy — Especially if sudden or ongoing.</li>
            <li>Breathing difficulties — Wheezing, coughing, or heavy panting at rest.</li>
            <li>Behavioural changes — Increased aggression, fear, confusion, or withdrawal could hint at pain or illness.</li>
            <li>Unusual lumps, bumps, or sores — Always have new growths checked by a vet.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>When in Doubt — See a Vet!</h3>
        <p>Early treatment often makes all the difference. Trust your instincts — you know your Aussie best</p>

        <h2>Colour Genetics</h2>
        <h3>Testing for the merle gene</h3>
        <p>Testing for the merle gene in Australian Shepherds is crucial because it affects both their coat color and their health. The merle pattern creates mottled patches of color, but when two merle “carriers” (dogs with one copy of the merle gene) are bred together, their offspring—called double merles—are at a higher risk of vision and hearing deficiencies. Some double merle dogs may be born blind or deaf.</p>
        <p>Additionally, some dogs may carry a cryptic merle gene, meaning they don’t appear merle but can still pass the gene to their puppies. Without testing, breeders might unknowingly produce double merle puppies, increasing the risk of health issues. For example an Australian shepherd may visually appear to be a black tri (K locus = black, being a dominant colour), due to this dominance it could mask a small area of merle, specifically if that merle patch is also situated within a dominant white area.</p>
        <p>Responsible breeders should test all breed potentials (Tri’s and Merle’s) for merle (M locus) and merle SINE insertion lengths, to ensure they pair dogs correctly and avoid risk. Understanding SINE lengths also leads to more predictable coat colors and patterns, because once a colour trait is lost in Australian Shepherds, it can be very difficult to reintroduce it into a breeding program. This is because coat color is determined by specific genetic combinations, and if a particular gene is bred out of a lineage, it may require multiple generations of careful breeding to bring it back. This is extremely important in a breed that is reliant on the solid colour to keep the breed healthy and diverse.</p>
