  <h3>CLUB HISTORY</h3>

    <div class="history-text">
      <h2>Our Journey: From Humble Beginnings to a Thriving Community</h2>
      <p>The story of the Australian Shepherd Club Western Cape is one of passion, dedication, and a shared love for this intelligent and versatile breed. Our roots trace back to June 2008, when a group of enthusiastic individuals came together with a common vision: to champion the Australian Shepherd in the Western Cape.</p>
      <p>The founding members – the late Veronica Neeby, Hannelie Basson, Jane Hughes, Seona Grobbelaar, Gerry Wade, Anne Turner, Simone Clark, and Judy Hirsch – laid the cornerstone for what we aspire to be today. Their aim was clear and resonant: to promote the breed's inherent qualities, ensure its well-being, and cultivate a thriving community of Australian Shepherd enthusiasts. Central to their mission was a commitment to upholding and maintaining the breed standard as meticulously defined by the Kennel Union of Southern Africa (KUSA).</p>
      <p>For a few years, the club served as a focal point for owners and admirers of Australian Shepherds in the region. It provided a platform for sharing knowledge, organizing gatherings, and fostering a deeper appreciation for the breed's intelligence, agility, and loyal companionship. However, despite the initial momentum and the strong bonds forged, the club eventually faced unforeseen challenges and was dissolved.</p>
      <p>Yet, the spirit and the passion for Australian Shepherds in the Western Cape did not fade. The seeds planted in 2008 continued to resonate, and in 2018, a renewed sense of purpose sparked the revival of the Australian Shepherd Club Western Cape. This time, building upon the foundations laid by the original members and fueled by the experiences of the interim years, the club emerged with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.</p>
      <p>Since its reformation in 2018, the Australian Shepherd Club Western Cape has gone from strength to strength. We have witnessed a growth in membership, a testament to the enduring appeal of the breed and the vibrant community we have cultivated. We continue to honour the original aims of our founders, actively promoting responsible ownership, supporting the health and welfare of Australian Shepherds, and educating the public about the breed's unique characteristics and needs.</p>
      <p>Our journey reflects the unwavering commitment of our members and the enduring charm of the Australian Shepherd. From the initial spark of an idea in 2008 to the thriving club we are today, our history is a testament to the power of shared passion and the enduring bond between humans and their canine companions. We look forward to many more years of celebrating this remarkable breed and fostering a strong and supportive community in the Western Cape.</p>

    </strong>
    <p>Integral to our purpose is the unwavering commitment to upholding and maintaining the breed standard as meticulously defined by the Kennel Union of Southern Africa (KUSA).

      <li><strong>Community and Connection</strong>: Our club is a place where Aussie lovers — from first-time owners to seasoned breeders — come together to share experiences, learn, and support one another.</li>
      <li><strong>Preservation and Education</strong>: We are committed to maintaining the integrity of the breed by encouraging responsible breeding practices and offering educational resources to the public.</li>

      <div class="full-bio">
        <p>Having recently embarked on a new chapter, we've immigrated to the breathtakingly beautiful city of Cape Town, making our way from the UK via a sojourn in Spain. Our journey with Australian Shepherds spans the last 24 years, a period deeply immersed in both the art of breeding and the thrill of showing these remarkable dogs. For us, the health and overall wellbeing of our Aussies have always been, and continue to be, paramount in every decision we make. While my heart initially belonged to the intelligent and agile Border Collies, it was the captivating charm and versatility of the Australian Shepherd that ultimately stole my heart. Now, I have the distinct honour and responsibility of serving as the Chairman of the Australian Shepherd Club of Western Cape, a role I approach with a firm commitment to openness and transparency in all our endeavours. Our home here in Cape Town is a lively and loving one, shared with our wonderful family of four Australian Shepherds and two cherished feline companions.</p>

Since then, she’s had the joy (and occasional chaos!) of sharing life with three Aussies, each one deepening her admiration for their spirited nature, emotional sensitivity, and endless energy.For Lizelle, they’re more than pets—they’re companions, confidants, and co-adventurers. Her Aussies share their home with a vibrant crew of three Pomeranians and four cats, creating a household full of personality and paw prints.With a heart fully committed to the breed and a passion for community, Lizelle is always ready to support the club and celebrate the dogs who bring us all together.

        <p>Gabi's journey in the world of purebred dogs began many years ago in the exciting realm of child and junior handling. It was there that her deep affection for Australian Shepherds first blossomed, nurtured by her beloved Aussies who have since crossed the rainbow bridge.

      <div class="full-bio">
        <p>Having recently relocated to the beautiful city of Cape Town from the UK, my husband and I bring with us 24 years of deep involvement with Australian Shepherds. For eight of those years, we proudly held the position of top Australian Shepherd breeders in the UK, culminating in the esteemed title of top all-breeds breeder in 2015. My passion for the breed and my commitment to excellence have led to extensive judging engagements across Europe. As a qualified herding judge and a breed specialist in the UK, I've had the distinct honour of judging at the prestigious Crufts show on two separate occasions. Furthermore, my judging experience extends to World Shows, European Shows, and numerous Club specialty shows around the globe. My passion for canine excellence extends beyond Australian Shepherds. Earlier in my involvement with purebreds, I had the pleasure of owning magnificent Old English Sheepdogs. I fondly recall the rewarding experience of personally grooming these impressive dogs in preparation for shows, a hands-on approach that deepened my understanding of breed-specific needs and presentation. Our home here in Cape Town is currently shared with our beloved family of four Australian Shepherds and two cherished cats.
